#Sol System
This mod is an attempt to add our very own home system, Sol, to Star Sector. It is not a perfect model, though it does try to adhere to some imperfect scale in an attempt to make it look right. It is also limited by the options provided by the game itself. Lore-wise, it doesn't make much sense due to Earth being a part of the game's own lore and being incredibly far from the setting of the game. But we can ignore that for the sake of the mod. The lore for the mod itself is fairly simple. The old inhabitants of Earth began colonizing the solar system, even getting so far as to begin terraforming Mars. At some point, an unknown event occured that led to the collapse of organized civilization. What is left of humanity in the entire solar system are just some primitive, fledling, lawless populations on Earth itself.
