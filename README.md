# Sol System
This mod is an attempt to add our very own home system, Sol, to Star Sector. It is not a 100% accurate model nor is it intended to be. That said, I did try to be true to reality as much as I could. The main goal besides adding the system, is to provide an extremely colonizable system with a ton of resources so that you don't need to colonize elsewhere. That means it is not balanced at all. If you wish to turn off preset planetary conditions in an attempt to not make it as overpowered, I provide instructions below.

I do have some lore planned for the mod as well. Though it is not lore-friendly with Star Sector itself considering the game takes places far away from Earth. My main focus has been actually creating the system and working on visuals. Lore comes second to that. See future plans below for a look into what the lore could be. Currently, the basic lore is that the inhabitants of Terra (Earth) began colonizing the system as well as beginning terraformation processes on Mars. Some unknown event occured and civilization on Terra collapsed, leaving all colonies stranded without needed resupply. They eventually died off. All that is left on Terra are primitive, lawless communities.
